# XibonAI Website


## Current Status

I have been working on this website for the past 5 hours and i donot really know how i made such big css mess and still managed to make it look good, a good starting point for our website, i don't even know why it looks so good to me


## To-Do

- Add the logo
- add actual pictures of the super brain interface after we make it
- Improve the styling and layout as needed.
- Add more visual content to enhance the user experience, if y'all ask me to
- make the stupid hamburger menu to a close icon on responsive view (update: noone is going to use it in their phone anyways so let that be a problem of the future)
- add actual xibonai information
- 
## How to see the website in your browser
- If you got live server installed then you're pretty much done
- if you want some simpler steps, just right click on the index.html file and click on ```copy path``` then paste in the path in your browser
