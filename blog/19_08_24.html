        <p>In today’s fast-paced, chaotic and rapidly evolving world, personal productivity is more than just a buzzword; it's a necessity. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), the landscape of productivity tools has undergone a significant transformation. AI-powered tools are not just enhancing efficiency but are also setting new standards for how we manage our time and tasks. This is not about how you can just be more efficient like what historical productivity tools allowed you to do but with AI it is now possible to add new capabilities to your workflows. For example a SuperBrain that not just makes you more efficient and productive but actually allows you to do things that were previously impossible. Xibon AI’s SuperBrain allows you to put your online research on autopilot as you know you have a trusted knowledge companion that will help you leverage relevant information you have come across online even if you forget or fail to make cognitive connections between different content. 
            AI productivity tools need to leverage sophisticated algorithms to learn from your behaviour and automate routine tasks in a manner that is specifically catered for you and not something generic. We are moving into an era of personalised and highly contextual productivity using AI, knowledge companions that understand you, your workflows and are unique in solving your specific problems as a knowledge worker. This is not about automating every task of yours but it is about making sure you have all the right tools available to do some of your best work. For instance, our AI solutions allow you to record your relevant online interactions such as reading an article, watching a tutorial, browsing helpful forums on reddit or elsewhere using Xibon AI’s SuperBrain and then generate documents that take in context from your online interactions, make cognitive connections between similar content while still making sure you are in control to add, edit, remove content from the generated documents.
