        <p>If your business is feeling overwhelmed at the whole wave of AI systems and developments that have come through in the last 18-24 months, this is actually quite common. One of the biggest problems I have seen is businesses starting with the technology first (Artificial Intelligence in this case) rather than looking at what problems they are solving, what value they want to derive from X or if implementing AI helps them do something better. Just as you would not use a forklift to eat some yoghurt out of your fridge, you should not implement AI in your business just for the sake of it or to follow what is trending. 

It is highly important to always go back to the fundamentals of your business and your situation first and once there is a plan to tackle something specific that matters to you and your business then it is the right time to look at the tools best designed for your needs (If it's AI perfect if not why use AI?). This takes a lot of the stress and overwhelmingness that comes with doing the exact opposite, which is to think of AI first and then drive yourself and others in your business nuts to find areas in your business where AI can be added. AI SaaS offerings (yes we have a SaaS product too - The SuperBrain) have particularly been successful in taking advantage of this Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) to push for solutions that add little to no value to businesses and individuals. 

First, it is important to understand where you are at with your business - 1) Do you have solid data pipelines and data management processes 2) Are your current business processes and workflows perfect (most cases no!) and ready to be replicated using AI? 3) Have you conducted any assessments that have given your business some ideas on where AI will generate most value v/s least value? 

The above are some of the questions that need to be explored and analysed before moving on to any AI powered solutions. Think of this if you have processes and workflows that are inefficient and below average, using AI to replicate what an employee was doing earlier still means replicating the wrong processes and setting up your business for disaster - This is something I have seen happen far too often. 

This is why going back to first principles and starting with business problems, opportunities and a solid understanding of what a business needs is far more important than looking at what cool AI system to inject in your current workflow.
