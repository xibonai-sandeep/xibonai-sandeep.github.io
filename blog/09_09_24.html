        <p>
          AI and in particular generative AI is certainly the flavour of the
          month and all proactive businesses are trying to hire talent that can
          help them get started on their AI journey. This might seem great as a
          strategy on paper but it comes up with its fair share of problems and
          pitfalls. One of the most common pitfalls I have seen is organisations
          hiring or trying to hire new talent to turbocharge their AI journey
          without having a plan in place on what business value AI will create
          for them. The first step should always be to start from identifying
          the business value AI powered solutions will create, what problems
          need to be solved or areas of the business that are primed for AI
          adoption in the early stages. Having answers to these questions and
          some small prototypes to solve actual business problems means you as
          business leaders know in great depth about the kind of talent you want
          for your business’ AI and data requirements. The questions that need
          to be answered in the early phases of an organisation’s AI journey
          include -
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            What business problems are we solving - Do we need new talent for
            generative AI use cases or more for Traditional Data Science use
            cases?
          </li>
          <li>
            What skills can we leverage from our existing pool of talent that
            can be taken over for some specific AI use cases? (This is
            impossible without identifying actual business needs and use cases
            for AI first).
          </li>
          <li>
            Do we need new talent more on the data side or actual AI
            implementation side? Bad or Untrustable Data = Bad AI solutions and
            wastage of resources so very important to understand where you need
            to bolster your human resources.
          </li>
          <li>
            Can we use existing internal resources plus any necessary third
            parties to test out some early use cases for implementation of AI
            prototypes to solve business problems? This helps mitigate your
            risks both for AI implementation and protects you from making the
            wrong hire for your AI talent.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        The above are just a few questions to get you started on whether you are ready to hire the right AI talent or are there steps you can take to make sure you are hiring the right people that your business really needs.
