    <div class="blog-text">
        <p>With the plethora of content that is freely accessible online to us and an ever growing hunger to learn something about a new topic, add to your existing skill set or just find ways to grow yourself as an individual or a business, there has never been a need for a second brain that could act as an extension of you. A personalised knowledge companion that truly understands you, your goals and your ways to solve YOUR problems. 

Rather than stressing over optimising every second of your life as a knowledge worker, I believe in the opposite - How can You find the laziest way to boost productivity and enhance your capabilities? This is where Xibon AI’s SuperBrain offering allows you the freedom to browse relevant content without the pressure of remembering everything or the stress of making sure content you are consuming can be leveraged later for whatever you are doing. This is how a true AI driven knowledge companion should work, it should extend human intelligence using its own intelligence. 

We have all heard about the phrase ‘It’s not about the destination but the journey’, while this is true for most things but this is not what we should aim at when building personalised AI systems. My opinion is that the journey matters less than the destination/outcomes for building personalised highly contextual AI systems, a content creator doing tons of research for creating compelling podcasts with real-time info most likely won’t care about remembering all the info they have researched but will deeply care about creating a compelling podcast. This is what I believe in, how can we leverage AI systems to remember things for us, be a personalised knowledge companion while allowing us to extend our capabilities and take our outputs (destination) to the next level at a quicker pace.
